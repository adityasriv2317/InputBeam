This is a public sharing area for game or software-specific config files.

The default config file includes resources and documentation information for controller bindings and keyboard/mouse events. Through this, you can build and design your own config files and, if you choose, PR them into this folder for the rest of the world to use and maintain. Gopher will automatically regenerate a config file if you delete it.
